| September 9  |  1:30-2pm  |                                                       Started thinking about how to approach the problem, mainly brainstorming on paper. talked with classmates about different cases, specifically when the hospital cost is lower than the highway cost |
| September 10 | 10-10:30pm |  Wrote out pseudocode ideas, but mostly ideas in english of how to approach the problem. right now the best thing i can come up with is going through each possible combination of hospitals & highways, but I know that cannot be the most efficient way |
